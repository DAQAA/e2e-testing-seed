# Seed Project for End-to-End Testing

This is a starter project for writing and running end-to-end (functional) tests, using [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/) and (optionally) [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/).

## Getting Started

1. This project uses [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/), so you'll need that installed on your machine first.
1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) or [download](https://github.com/eheikes/e2e-testing-seed/archive/master.zip) this repository onto your local machine.
1. Open a terminal in the cloned folder and run `npm install`.
